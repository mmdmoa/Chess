A normal and simple chess game made with Pygame

# Notation

The project fails if you run it, you should download stockfish's binaries from https://stockfishchess.org, according to your os and cpu,
and then replace the path of the AI in common_resources with it.
it's messy but it works.

# Requirements

```commandline
pip uninstall pygame
```
first remove pygame-de

```commandline
pip install pygame-ce
```

then install pygame-ce and you should be good to go
